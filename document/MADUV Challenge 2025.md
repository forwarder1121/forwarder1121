# MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place

## Overview

The MADUV Challenge 2025 invited researchers from around the world to develop models that classify mice as either wild-type or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. The challenge provided high-sampling-rate audio data and encouraged the use of cutting-edge speech and signal processing techniques to handle this complex data. The goal was to explore whether the individual differences in mice vocalizations parallel those observed in human speech research.

## My Contribution

- **Swin Transformer Implementation:**  
  Developed and implemented a Swin Transformer-based model for effective classification on mel-spectrogram representations derived from the ultrasound data.
  
- **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:**  
  Designed and built an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into robust mel-spectrogram features, enabling improved feature extraction for the classification task.
  
- **Achievement:**  
  Secured **3rd Place** in the MADUV Challenge 2025.
