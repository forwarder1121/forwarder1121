## Awards & Achievements

### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place with 2D-Siwn
**Overview:**  
The MADUV Challenge 2025 invited participants to develop models to classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Our solution employed a **2D-Siwn-based feature extraction** method combined with a Swin Transformer to effectively process and classify the audio data.

**My Contribution:**  
- Developed a 2D-Siwn-based approach for robust feature extraction from ultrasound data.  
- Fine-tuned the final classification threshold for optimal performance.  
- Achieved **3rd Place** in the challenge.
