## Awards & Achievements

### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place  
**Overview:**  
The MADUV Challenge 2025 invited researchers to develop models that classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Advanced signal processing techniques were used to handle complex audio data.

**My Contribution:**  
- **Swin Transformer Implementation:** Applied a Swin Transformer for effective classification on mel-spectrogram representations of the ultrasound data.  
- **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:** Developed an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into mel-spectrograms for robust feature extraction.  
- **Achievement:** Secured **3rd Place** in the challenge.
