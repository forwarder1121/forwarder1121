### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place

**Overview:**  
The MADUV Challenge 2025 called for models to classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. In this challenge, state-of-the-art speech and signal processing techniques were employed to analyze complex audio data.

**My Contribution:**  
- **Swin Transformer Implementation:** Leveraged a Swin Transformer model to perform robust image classification on mel-spectrogram representations of the ultrasound data.
- **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:** Developed an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into mel-spectrograms, enabling effective feature extraction and model training.
