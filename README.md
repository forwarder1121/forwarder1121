### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place

**Overview:**
The **MADUV Challenge 2025** was part of **INTERSPEECH 2025**, inviting researchers worldwide to develop models that classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Advanced signal processing techniques were used to handle complex audio data in this globally recognized event.

**My Contribution:**

* **Swin Transformer Implementation:** Explored multiple Swin Transformer variants by reviewing recent research papers, implementing the approaches, and conducting thorough experiments.
* **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:** Developed an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into mel-spectrograms for robust feature extraction.

### EmoChat – Real-time Emotion & Stress Voice Chat App

**Overview:**
An end-to-end voice-based chat application that captures speech, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper, predicts emotional stress levels via Hugging Face audio model, and reflects the result in real-time chat UI (e.g., warning modal, balloon color shift).

**Highlights:**

* 📱 **Built with React Native (Expo)**, customized GiftedChat UI
* 🧠 **AI integration**: Whisper STT + Hugging Face Inference API
* 🗂 **Realtime BaaS**: Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage
* 📊 Integrated lightweight **voice-only stress recognition model** via knowledge distillation
* 🎯 Final deployment with attention to UX (alert modals, message color change)
