## 🏆 Awards & Achievements

### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place

**Overview:**
The **MADUV Challenge 2025** was part of **INTERSPEECH 2025**, inviting researchers worldwide to develop models that classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Advanced signal processing techniques were used to handle complex audio data in this globally recognized event.

**My Contribution:**

* **Swin Transformer Implementation:** Explored multiple Swin Transformer variants by reviewing recent research papers, implementing the approaches, and conducting thorough experiments.
* **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:** Developed an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into mel-spectrograms for robust feature extraction.

## Projects 

### EmoChat – Real-time Emotion & Stress Voice Chat App ( Personal Project : FE + Baas + AI research + deploy )

**Overview:**
An end-to-end voice-based chat application that captures speech, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper, predicts emotional stress levels via Hugging Face audio model, and reflects the result in real-time chat UI (e.g., warning modal, balloon color shift).

**Highlights:**

* 📱 **Built with React Native (Expo)**, customized GiftedChat UI
* 🧠 **AI integration**: Whisper STT + Hugging Face Inference API
* 🗂 **Realtime BaaS**: Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage
* 📊 Integrated lightweight **voice-only stress recognition model** via knowledge distillation

### SER-Chatbot – Speech-Emotion & Stress Web Chatbot

*(Personal Project · FE + BE + AI Research + DevOps · **Journal/Conference paper under preparation**)*

**Overview**
Browser-based chatbot that listens to the user’s voice, transcribes it (Whisper), estimates **emotion** (7-class) and **stress level** (2-class StudentNet), then generates a persona-aware GPT-4 reply—everything rendered live in Streamlit with dynamic badges, gauges, and RAG-augmented context.

**Highlights**
