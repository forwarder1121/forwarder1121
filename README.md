**Overview:**  
The MADUV Challenge 2025 called for models to classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Our solution used a 2D-Siwn-based feature extraction method combined with a Swin Transformer to effectively process and classify the audio data.

**My Contribution:**  
- Developed a 2D-Siwn-based approach for extracting robust features from ultrasound data.  
- Fine-tuned the final classification threshold for optimal performance.  
- Achieved **3rd place** in the challenge.

**Repository Contents:**  
- Training and inference code for the Swin Transformer model.  
- Scripts for threshold optimization and result generation.
