## Awards & Achievements

### MADUV Challenge 2025 – 3rd Place  
**Overview:**  
The **MADUV Challenge 2025** was part of **INTERSPEECH 2025**, inviting researchers worldwide to develop models that classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations. Advanced signal processing techniques were used to handle complex audio data in this globally recognized event.

**My Contribution:**  
- **Swin Transformer Implementation:** Explored multiple Swin Transformer variants by reviewing recent research papers, implementing the approaches, and conducting thorough experiments.  
- **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion Pipeline:** Developed an end-to-end pipeline to convert raw ultrasound vocalizations into mel-spectrograms for robust feature extraction.  
- **Achievement:** Secured **3rd Place** in the challenge.
